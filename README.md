# to-do-list
A to-do list able to store data in the localhost.
Its looks simple but, it stores data and, you can edit the tasks.
Also, if you completed the task, the task by itself go to the botttom of the list, so, theres no need to use any tab to arrange the tasks.
Also it haves a beatiful look so, enjoy.

There is a bug but, its up to you find it.
